Welcome to the System Modelling team!

This README lists all the wonderful tools that have been developed to make your life easier.


## General
These are general purpose tools and are not team specific

- [Acronyms-Word](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/Acronyms-Word), to extract all acronyms in a word file

## CAE team
These tools are specific for CAE analyses

### Pre-processing
- [extract-dpa](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/extract-dpa), tool for the extraction of DPA values at specified locations from a .vtk
- [EM-interpolator](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/EM-Interpolator), interpolation of EM loads on mechanical mesh
- [DAF-calculation](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/DAF-calculation), computation of DAF from force/moments time histories
- [load-transient-EM](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/load-transient-EM), load all EM forces at each step for a transient analysis

### Post-processing
- [ansyspp](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/ansyspp), a python package for ULVM stress maps of recombined loads
- [export-lin-stress](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/export-lin-stress), python and ACT script for the esxtraction of linearized stresses
- [KAISER](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/KAISER), tool for the stress assessment according to design codes
- [get-section-action](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/get-section-actions), extract from mechanical the forces and moments acting on bolts or pipe sections
- [usr-defined-ulvm](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/usr-defined-ulvm), ACT script for the definition of complex user defined results for ULVM load recombination
- [beam-extract-F-M-u](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/beam-extract-F-M-u), extract forces and moments or displacements for beams
- [surface-extract-u](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/surface-extract-u), extract surface displacements from mechanical
- [modal-recombination](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/modal-recombination), collection of scripts to recombine modal linearized stresses

### Other
- [apdl-commands](https://github.com/Systems-Modelling-Unit-NiER/apdl-commands), collection of apdl commands to be used inside workbench
